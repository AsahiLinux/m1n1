# m1n1: an experimentation playground for Apple Silicon

(And to some extent a Linux bootloader)

## Building

You need an `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` cross-compiler toolchain (or a native one, if running on ARM64).
You also need `dtc` (the devicetree compiler) and `convert` (from ImageMagick) for the boot logos.

```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/AsahiLinux/m1n1.git
$ cd m1n1
$ make
```

The output will be in build/m1n1.macho.

To build on a native arm64 machine, use `make ARCH=`.

Building on ARM64 macOS is supported with clang and LLVM; you need to use Homebrew to
install the required dependencies:

```shell
$ brew install llvm imagemagick dtc
```

After that, just type `make`.

### Building using the container setup

If you have a container runtime installed, like Podman or Docker, you can make use of the compose setup, which contains all build dependencies.

```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/AsahiLinux/m1n1.git
$ cd m1n1
$ podman-compose run m1n1 make
$ # or
$ docker-compose run m1n1 make
```

## Usage

Our [developer quickstart](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Developer-Quickstart#using-m1n1)
guide has more information on how to use m1n1.

To install on an OS container based on macOS <12.1, use `m1n1.macho`:

```shell
kmutil configure-boot -c m1n1.macho -v <path to your OS volume>
```

To install on an OS container based on macOS >=12.1, use `m1n1.bin`:

```shell
kmutil configure-boot -c m1n1.bin --raw --entry-point 2048 --lowest-virtual-address 0 -v <path to your OS volume>
```

## Payloads

m1n1 supports running payloads by simple concatenation:

```shell
$ cat build/m1n1.macho Image.gz build/dtb/apple-j274.dtb initramfs.cpio.gz > m1n1-payload.macho
$ cat build/m1n1.bin Image.gz build/dtb/apple-j274.dtb initramfs.cpio.gz > m1n1-payload.bin
```

Supported payload file formats:

* Kernel images (or compatible). Must be compressed or last payload.
* Devicetree blobs (FDT). May be uncompressed or compressed.
* Initramfs cpio images. Must be compressed.

Supported compression formats:

* gzip
* xz
