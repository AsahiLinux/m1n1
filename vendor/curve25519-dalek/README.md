**A pure-Rust implementation of group operations on Ristretto and Curve25519.**

`curve25519-dalek` is a library providing group operations on the Edwards and
Montgomery forms of Curve25519, and on the prime-order Ristretto group.

`curve25519-dalek` is not intended to provide implementations of any particular
crypto protocol.  Rather, implementations of those protocols (such as
[`x25519-dalek`][x25519-dalek] and [`ed25519-dalek`][ed25519-dalek]) should use
`curve25519-dalek` as a library.

`curve25519-dalek` is intended to provide a clean and safe _mid-level_ API for use
implementing a wide range of ECC-based crypto protocols, such as key agreement,
signatures, anonymous credentials, rangeproofs, and zero-knowledge proof
systems.

In particular, `curve25519-dalek` implements Ristretto, which constructs a
prime-order group from a non-prime-order Edwards curve.  This provides the
speed and safety benefits of Edwards curve arithmetic, without the pitfalls of
cofactor-related abstraction mismatches.

# Documentation

The semver-stable, public-facing `curve25519-dalek` API is documented
[here][docs-external].  In addition, the unstable internal implementation
details are documented [here][docs-internal].

The `curve25519-dalek` documentation requires a custom HTML header to include
KaTeX for math support. Unfortunately `cargo doc` does not currently support
this, but docs can be built using
```sh
make doc
make doc-internal
```

# Use

To import `curve25519-dalek`, add the following to the dependencies section of
your project's `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
curve25519-dalek = "3"
```

The sole breaking change in the `3.x` series was an update to the `digest`
version, and in terms of non-breaking changes it includes:

* support for using `alloc` instead of `std` on stable Rust,
* the Elligator2 encoding for Edwards points,
* a fix to use `packed_simd2`,
* various documentation fixes and improvements,
* support for configurably-sized, precomputed lookup tables for basepoint scalar
  multiplication,
* two new formally-verified field arithmetic backends which use the Fiat Crypto
  Rust code, which is generated from proofs of functional correctness checked by
  the Coq theorem proving system, and
* support for explicitly calling the `zeroize` traits for all point types.

The `2.x` series has API almost entirely unchanged from the `1.x` series,
except that:

* an error in the data modeling for the (optional) `serde` feature was
  corrected, so that when the `2.x`-series `serde` implementation is used
  with `serde-bincode`, the derived serialization matches the usual X/Ed25519
  formats;
* the `rand` version was updated.

See `CHANGELOG.md` for more details.

# Backends and Features

The `nightly` feature enables features available only when using a Rust nightly
compiler.  In particular, it is required for rendering documentation and for
the SIMD backends.

Curve arithmetic is implemented using one of the following backends:

* a `u32` backend using serial formulas and `u64` products;
* a `u64` backend using serial formulas and `u128` products;
* an `avx2` backend using [parallel formulas][parallel_doc] and `avx2` instructions (sets speed records);
* an `ifma` backend using [parallel formulas][parallel_doc] and `ifma` instructions (sets speed records);

By default the `u64` backend is selected.  To select a specific backend, use:
```sh
cargo build --no-default-features --features "std u32_backend"
cargo build --no-default-features --features "std u64_backend"
# Requires nightly, RUSTFLAGS="-C target_feature=+avx2" to use avx2
cargo build --no-default-features --features "std simd_backend"
# Requires nightly, RUSTFLAGS="-C target_feature=+avx512ifma" to use ifma
cargo build --no-default-features --features "std simd_backend"
```
Crates using `curve25519-dalek` can either select a backend on behalf of their
users, or expose feature flags that control the `curve25519-dalek` backend.

The `std` feature is enabled by default, but it can be disabled for no-`std`
builds using `--no-default-features`.  Note that this requires explicitly
selecting an arithmetic backend using one of the `_backend` features.
If no backend is selected, compilation will fail.

# Safety

The `curve25519-dalek` types are designed to make illegal states
unrepresentable.  For example, any instance of an `EdwardsPoint` is
guaranteed to hold a point on the Edwards curve, and any instance of a
`RistrettoPoint` is guaranteed to hold a valid point in the Ristretto
group.

All operations are implemented using constant-time logic (no
secret-dependent branches, no secret-dependent memory accesses),
unless specifically marked as being variable-time code.
We believe that our constant-time logic is lowered to constant-time
assembly, at least on `x86_64` targets.

As an additional guard against possible future compiler optimizations,
the `subtle` crate places an optimization barrier before every
conditional move or assignment.  More details can be found in [the
documentation for the `subtle` crate][subtle_doc].

Some functionality (e.g., multiscalar multiplication or batch
inversion) requires heap allocation for temporary buffers.  All
heap-allocated buffers of potentially secret data are explicitly
zeroed before release.

However, we do not attempt to zero stack data, for two reasons.
First, it's not possible to do so correctly: we don't have control
over stack allocations, so there's no way to know how much data to
wipe.  Second, because `curve25519-dalek` provides a mid-level API,
the correct place to start zeroing stack data is likely not at the
entrypoints of `curve25519-dalek` functions, but at the entrypoints of
functions in other crates.

The implementation is memory-safe, and contains no significant
`unsafe` code.  The SIMD backend uses `unsafe` internally to call SIMD
intrinsics.  These are marked `unsafe` only because invoking them on an
inappropriate CPU would cause `SIGILL`, but the entire backend is only
compiled with appropriate `target_feature`s, so this cannot occur.

# Performance

Benchmarks are run using [`criterion.rs`][criterion]:

```sh
cargo bench --no-default-features --features "std u32_backend"
cargo bench --no-default-features --features "std u64_backend"
# Uses avx2 or ifma only if compiled for an appropriate target.
export RUSTFLAGS="-C target_cpu=native"
cargo bench --no-default-features --features "std simd_backend"
```

Performance is a secondary goal behind correctness, safety, and
clarity, but we aim to be competitive with other implementations.

# FFI

Unfortunately, we have no plans to add FFI to `curve25519-dalek` directly.  The
reason is that we use Rust features to provide an API that maintains safety
invariants, which are not possible to maintain across an FFI boundary.  For
instance, as described in the _Safety_ section above, invalid points are
impossible to construct, and this would not be the case if we exposed point
operations over FFI.

However, `curve25519-dalek` is designed as a *mid-level* API, aimed at
implementing other, higher-level primitives.  Instead of providing FFI at the
mid-level, our suggestion is to implement the higher-level primitive (a
signature, PAKE, ZKP, etc) in Rust, using `curve25519-dalek` as a dependency,
and have that crate provide a minimal, byte-buffer-oriented FFI specific to
that primitive.

# About

**SPOILER ALERT:** *The Twelfth Doctor's first encounter with the Daleks is in
his second full episode, "Into the Dalek". A beleaguered ship of the "Combined
Galactic Resistance" has discovered a broken Dalek that has turned "good",
desiring to kill all other Daleks. The Doctor, Clara and a team of soldiers
are miniaturized and enter the Dalek, which the Doctor names Rusty. They
repair the damage, but accidentally restore it to its original nature, causing
it to go on the rampage and alert the Dalek fleet to the whereabouts of the
rebel ship. However, the Doctor manages to return Rusty to its previous state
by linking his mind with the Dalek's: Rusty shares the Doctor's view of the
universe's beauty, but also his deep hatred of the Daleks. Rusty destroys the
other Daleks and departs the ship, determined to track down and bring an end
to the Dalek race.*

`curve25519-dalek` is authored by Isis Agora Lovecruft and Henry de Valence. 

Portions of this library were originally a port of [Adam Langley's
Golang ed25519 library](https://github.com/agl/ed25519), which was in
turn a port of the reference `ref10` implementation.  Most of this code,
including the 32-bit field arithmetic, has since been rewritten.

The fast `u32` and `u64` scalar arithmetic was implemented by Andrew Moon, and
the addition chain for scalar inversion was provided by Brian Smith.  The
optimised batch inversion was contributed by Sean Bowe and Daira Hopwood.

The `no_std` and `zeroize` support was contributed by Tony Arcieri.

The formally verified backends, `fiat_u32_backend` and `fiat_u64_backend`, which
integrate with the Rust generated by the
[Fiat Crypto project](https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto) were contributed
by Fran√ßois Garillot.
