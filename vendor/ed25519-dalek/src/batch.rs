/// # Notes on Nonce Generation & Malleability
///
/// ## On Synthetic Nonces
///
/// This library defaults to using what is called "synthetic" nonces, which
/// means that a mixture of deterministic (per any unique set of inputs to this
/// function) data and system randomness is used to seed the CSPRNG for nonce
/// generation.  For more of the background theory on why many cryptographers
/// currently believe this to be superior to either purely deterministic
/// generation or purely relying on the system's randomness, see [this section
/// of the Merlin design](https://merlin.cool/transcript/rng.html) by Henry de
/// Valence, isis lovecruft, and Oleg Andreev, as well as Trevor Perrin's
/// [designs for generalised
/// EdDSA](https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/curves/2017/000925.html).
///
/// ## On Deterministic Nonces
///
/// In order to be ammenable to protocols which require stricter third-party
/// auditability trails, such as in some financial cryptographic settings, this
/// library also supports a `--features=batch_deterministic` setting, where the
/// nonces for batch signature verification are derived purely from the inputs
/// to this function themselves.
///
/// **This is not recommended for use unless you have several cryptographers on
///   staff who can advise you in its usage and all the horrible, terrible,
///   awful ways it can go horribly, terribly, awfully wrong.**
///
/// In any sigma protocol it is wise to include as much context pertaining
/// to the public state in the protocol as possible, to avoid malleability
/// attacks where an adversary alters publics in an algebraic manner that
/// manages to satisfy the equations for the protocol in question.
///
/// For ed25519 batch verification (both with synthetic and deterministic nonce
/// generation), we include the following as scalars in the protocol transcript:
///
/// * All of the computed `H(R||A||M)`s to the protocol transcript, and
/// * All of the `s` components of each signature.
///
/// Each is also prefixed with their index in the vector.
///
/// The former, while not quite as elegant as adding the `R`s, `A`s, and
/// `M`s separately, saves us a bit of context hashing since the
/// `H(R||A||M)`s need to be computed for the verification equation anyway.
///
/// The latter prevents a malleability attack only found in deterministic batch
/// signature verification (i.e. only when compiling `ed25519-dalek` with
/// `--features batch_deterministic`) wherein an adversary, without access
/// to the signing key(s), can take any valid signature, `(s,R)`, and swap
/// `s` with `s' = -z1`.  This doesn't contitute a signature forgery, merely
/// a vulnerability, as the resulting signature will not pass single
/// signature verification.  (Thanks to Github users @real_or_random and
/// @jonasnick for pointing out this malleability issue.)
///
/// For an additional way in which signatures can be made to probablistically
/// falsely "pass" the synthethic batch verification equation *for the same
/// inputs*, but *only some crafted inputs* will pass the deterministic batch
/// single, and neither of these will ever pass single signature verification,
/// see the documentation for [`PublicKey.validate()`].
