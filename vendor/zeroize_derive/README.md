Custom derive support for [zeroize]: a crate for securely zeroing memory
while avoiding compiler optimizations.

This crate isn't intended to be used directly.
See [zeroize] crate for documentation.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.51** or newer.

In the future, we reserve the right to change MSRV (i.e. MSRV is out-of-scope
for this crate's SemVer guarantees), however when we do it will be accompanied by
a minor version bump.
